kali-themes (2019.4.8) kali-experimental; urgency=medium

  * Drop 1920x1080 from the list of resolutions to try for GRUB
  * Fix path to background images in XFCE and lightdm config
  * Fix gsettings to actually enable the correct theme
  * Add gsettings overriding the background images for GNOME
  * Update files with latest changes from Daniel
  * Change priority of gsettings to be above kali-defaults/desktop-base
  * Move all files installed below /usr/share in the same directory.
    Also move the grub theme to /usr/share/grub/themes/kali/ as installing
    files in /boot/ is problematic on arm where /boot is often a vfat
    partition that doesn't support hardlinks as required by dpkg.
  * Instead copy grub theme to /boot during postinst.
    The goal is to not break ARM images using vfat for /boot while
    still providing the theme in /boot so that it can be available
    even when /usr/share/ is not available.
  * Fix path to grub backgrounds in update-alternatives calls
  * Use dark theme by default in GNOME too
  * Drop the "Provides: desktop-base" on kali-desktop-base so that we can
    still force the installation of desktop-base with a Depends on it.
